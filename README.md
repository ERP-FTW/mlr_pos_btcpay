Lightning Rod Point of Sale BTCPay server extension module Readme

Overview
<br>This custom module for Odoo 16+ to add BTCPay server as a payment method to the Point-of-Sale application. BTCPay server acts as a payment gateway/provider for Bitcoin on-chain and lightning transactions, and is queried by API calls from Odoo. BTCPay server is added as a new electronic payment method to the POS and BTCPay server access is provided by API to Odoo. The payment method can be set to provide a web URL for the customer to pay on a BTCPay server portal site or lightning/on-chain invoice so they pay directly from their wallet. A created invoice for an order is printed on the bill receipt for scanning by customers on paper or the screen. A customer can choose to pay in Lightning or a traditional payment method. The POS Validate payment button will check the status of the invoice and mark the order as paid if the invoice is settled. The method will also check the status of the payment every minute and validate the payment if made. Conversion rate and invoiced satoshis are stored for each order.
